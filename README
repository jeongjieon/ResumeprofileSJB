Hello,

Recently built a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which serves as a platform to showcase my professional resume. With the increasing trend towards digitalization, I felt it was necessary to have a digital presence that accurately represents my skills, experiences, and achievements.

The website I have created is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my career and educational background, as well as my skills and achievements. I have utilized various HTML tags and CSS styling to ensure that the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate. In addition, I have incorporated JavaScript features to add interactivity and enhance the user experience.
